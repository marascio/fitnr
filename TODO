* Add social links.

* Add archive index page. This page should provide an ordered list, by
  publish date, of the posts. The major grouping is by year.

* Render tags and add tag index pages. A tag index page is a list of all
  tags and subsequent lists of all posts with that tag, ordered by date.
  Each post link should point to the archive entry for that post.

* Add search using Google.

* Add delicious link roll.

* Add a contact me link.

* Debug IE6 sidebar issue.

Done
====
* (2008/07/09) Generate archive index and archive entries for each post.
  Should be of the form:

    archives/<year>/<month>/<title>.html

* (2008/07/09) Add intersite links. I should able to put something like
  this as the destination for a link, and it should be fixed up for me:

    $some-post -> archives/<year>/<month>/some-post.html
