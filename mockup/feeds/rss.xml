          <p>Well, I suppose it's time. I've avoided jumping online with
          an official-like presence for long enough. At this point I
          feel like the guy in the 90's who was still using a Walkman
          listening to cassette tapes.</p>

          <p>What will you find here? Mostly a discussion on software
          development, software teams, and other related technical bits
          and pieces. You'll find a healthy dose of cynicism and
          pragmatism in my viewpoints, but more importantly I hope
          there is a fair bit of humor.</p>
